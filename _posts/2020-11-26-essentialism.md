Read a fiction book for 20 minutes in the morning, before starting to worry
about the day's professional and personal problems.

Keep a journal! Write your "kairos" moments in it. Kairos = the fully present
moments in your day.

Focus on "one main thing" for the day. Focus on the now, it’s all you can change.
Fully focus on task at hand, have your mind and body in the same place.

Spend 30 seconds after meetings reflecting on what was said, take some notes
and gather actions if necessary.

Make some time "to just think": no phones, computers or other distractions.

Find your **essential intent**. Values are often vague, whereas vision is often
too broad.

```
Essential Intent = concrete + inspirational 
```

Establish a routine, do important things automatically.

Organise your work days by themes. For example, Monday can be "coding", Tuesday
"meetings", and so on.

Pause before walking through the door home and breathe - creates a barrier
between work and life.

## How to say no

Say "no" to most things in your life so you can say "yes" to the things that
most excite you. Some ways to say no:

- I’m currently busy with X, but let’s catch up on Y
- Let me check my calendar and get back to you
- Yes, what should I de-prioritise?
- You’re welcome to do X, I can do Y
- I can’t, but [person name] might
- Use humour
