I often listen to a single song on repeat for hours on end while coding or trying to do "deep work". I thought that was just me being weird. It turns out it's actually good for focus.

People who do this too include [Tim Feriss](https://tim.blog/2015/02/23/glitch-mob/) and [Ryan Holiday](https://ryanholiday.net/the-guilty-crazy-secret-that-helps-me-write/). There's even a [book](https://www.amazon.com/Repeat-How-Music-Plays-Mind/dp/0199990824) about how listening to music on repeat affects your brain.

Next time you need to focus, pick a song, preferably an instrumental-heavy one, and listen to it on repeat. I've made a [Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0Bb8w8h2XBJLhMgFK77BfU) with some of my favourites. Beware though, it's mainly Daft Punk.
