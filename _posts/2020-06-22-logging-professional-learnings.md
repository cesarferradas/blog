title: Logging your professional learnings
---

Why do we stop taking notes after university? We certainly don't stop learning.

At university, our main focus is learning new concepts. We establish habits and
use tools to this effect. Notebooks, digitial note-taking applications,
diagrams, and so on. And it's usually very effective. We're able to absorb huge
amounts of information in a relatively short period of time.

If this theoretical knowledge is combined with practice and repetition, we
commit it to our long-term memory. 

In our professional lives, it's not that different. The balance is more skewed
towards practice rather than theory, but both play a role in how we develop in
our careers.

That's why it's _so_ important to log our professional learnings. To not let
the balance go to far down the practical, and keep a healthy amount of
theoretical and structured learning.

I recently started a glossary of technical terms as a way to achieve this aim.
My professional note-taking is not limited to this method, but I've found huge
benefits with this method alone.

Here is how my process works:

In meetings, or when researching how to implement a new technical feature, I
usually take notes of what I find, which I also tend to keep for future
reference.

After note-taking, I set aside some time to review those notes and look for
technical terms. Here's where I do one of two things:

1. If I've never heard it before, I add an entry in my glossary and make sure I
   add a definition straight away, maybe with some examples.
2. If I _have_ heard it before, I **first** try to remember what it means, but
   if not, I'll just remind myself of the definition by referencing my
   glossary.

Either way, I either learn something new or strengthen existing memories.

I encourage everyone to try this, especially those of us who are in technical
fields. It's easy to lose track of tech jargon, and even _misuse_ certain
concepts you've heard before if we're not dilligent about finding good
definitions of these concepts.

Give it a go, and review what you've learnt in a few months. I bet it's a lot!
