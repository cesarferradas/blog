title: Creating daily
---

We spend most of our time outside of work consuming content, not producing it. We consume movies, social media feeds, songs, etc.

It's rare that we spend time _creating_. I think this is partly because, after a productive day at work, where one usually produces some sort of content, we just want to zone out, relax, and do the opposite.

But associating creativity with work and consumption with leisure is misguided. One can get so much satisfaction out of producing, too. And my theory is that, as with many things worth doing in life, even though it's harder to produce than to consume, it is infinitely more rewarding.

That's why I'm writing this blog, daily, for 100 days. I want to get into the habit of writing so that I get into the habit of creating for fun and for personal growth. I'm trying to make writing my **keystone habit**, as defined by [Charles Duhigg](https://charlesduhigg.com/), the author of _The Power of Habit_:

> Keystone habits offer what is known within academic literature as ‘small wins.’ They help other habits to flourish by creating new structures, and they establish cultures where change becomes contagious.

Ask yourself: what can I create every day? Maybe you create a meaningful conversation with your significant other, family member, or best friend. Maybe you start growing your own vegetables, baking your own bread, building your own DIY furniture or coding a software project.

The world is too beautiful for us not to use its resources to our advantage.
