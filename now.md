# What I'm doing now

_(This is my [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). If you have your own
site, you should make one too)_

Living in London, UK.

Working full-time as a Software Engineer, mainly backend, specifically in
database and API development.

Have become a regular coffee drinker. Trying to further develop my palate for
the different coffee varieties, roast levels, origins and so on. My current
brew method is the AeroPress, although enjoy a good v60 too.

Enjoying learning more about time-tested board games, like Chess, Backgammon
and Poker. There is a reason why all of these are still around!

Trying to write more, so hopefully you see more articles in my blog soon.
