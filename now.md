you should make one too!)_

**Living** in London, UK.

**Working** as a Software Engineer, mainly backend, specifically in database and
API development.

**Eating** vegan since June 2014.

**Drinking** specialty coffee. Trying different coffee origins, roast levels,
processing and brewing methods. My daily driver is the Hario v60.

**Reading** [On the Shortness of Life](https://amzn.to/3mLpgZi){:target="_blank"}
by Seneca

**Playing** a lot of chess, both online with strangers and in real life with my
girlfriend and close friends.

**Learning** how to run with barefoot/minimalist shoes. Focusing on a cadence of
180 steps per minute and landing with my mid-foot. Still only doing short runs
to get the leg muscles and tendons used to it. Trying to run twice a week at
least.
