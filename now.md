_(This is a [now page](https://nownownow.com/about). If you have your own site,
you should make one too!)_

Living in London, United Kingdom.

Working full-time as a Software Engineer, mainly backend, specifically in
database and API development.

Improving my appreciation for specialty coffee. Trying different coffee
varieties, roast levels, origins and so on. I'm currently brewing with the
v60 and the AeroPress.

Enjoying learning more about time-tested board games, like Chess, Backgammon
and Poker. There is a reason why all of these are still around!

Getting back into running. Experimenting with barefoot running using Vibram
FiveFingers. Feet and calves are still sore after a light run/walk so taking
it slow.
