_Playing_ a lot of chess, both online with strangers and in real life with my
girlfriend and close friends.

_Learning_ how to run with barefoot/minimalist shoes. Focusing on a cadence of
180 steps per minute and landing with my mid-foot. Still only doing short runs
to get the leg muscles and tendons used to it. Trying to run twice a week at
least.
