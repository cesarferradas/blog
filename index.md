## About

Hi, my name is **CÃ©sar**.

I'm a software engineer focused on building lean, robust and elegant systems
for startups. I'm a generalist at heart so I love working with different
technologies and have built systems in various languages, with and without
frameworks.

For more details about my professional experience, here's my
[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/cesarferradas).

If you want to know what I'm up to at the moment, read my [now page](/now).

## Blog

I sometimes write about things I'm interested in which I also hope can add
value to other people. That includes but is not limited to:

* Software Development
* Cybersecurity and Privacy
* Minimalism
* Productivity
* Sustainability
* Personal Finance
* Startups

You can find my posts [here](/blog) on this site, but also over at
