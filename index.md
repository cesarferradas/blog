## About

Software Engineer focused on building lean, robust and elegant systems
for startups. I'm a generalist at heart so I love working with different
technologies and have built systems in various languages, with and without
frameworks.

For more details about my professional experience, visit my
[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/cesarferradas) profile. If you want to know
what I'm up to at the moment, go to my [now page](/now).

## Contact

The best way to reach me is via email. To get my email address, run this shell
command (or figure it out, trying to avoid spam bots!):

```shell
echo contactatcesardotsh | sed 's/at/@/' | sed 's/dot/./'
```
