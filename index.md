Resourceful and curious Software Engineer. I enjoy building software for early
stage startups. I find that's where the most interesting technical challenges
are, which call for creative solutions.

I'm a generalist at heart so I love working with different technologies and
have built systems in various languages, with and without frameworks.

When I find a problem in open-source tools I'm using, I try to contribute to
their development like I did with
[Flasgger](https://github.com/flasgger/flasgger/pull/340),
[RQ](https://github.com/rq/rq/pull/1514) and
[Tofu](https://github.com/calleluks/Tofu/pull/44).

I studied Computer Science with a minor in Entrepreneurship at University
College London, but I've learnt the most about building good quality systems
from actually trying to code stuff!
