Welcome to my personal blog.

I write about things I'm interested in which I also hope can add value to other people. That includes but is not limited to: software, security, minimalism, sustainability, startups and habits.

However, I keep this blog mainly for myself, as a way to log and organise my thoughts, experiences and learnings. So some of the posts might be completely random and boring.
