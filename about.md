Welcome to my blog.

I write about things I'm interested in which I also hope can add value to other people. That includes but is not limited to:

* Software Engineering
* Cybersecurity and Privacy
* Productivity
* Minimalism
* Sustainability
* Personal Finance
* Startups

### Contact

The best way to reach me is via email. I've obscured my email address to dodge harvesting bots, so if you can't infer it from the below command, run it in a Unix-like shell.

```shell
echo blogatcesardotsh | sed 's/at/@/' | sed 's/dot/./'
```

Otherwise, here are my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cesarferradas) and [GitHub](https://github.com/cesarferradas).
